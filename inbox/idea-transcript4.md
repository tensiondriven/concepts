Yeah, okay, one of the ideas was a sort of anism inspired thing where you take like a conversation feed or something and you do some sort of a a recognition on it in the intensity recognition and created create enough textil or something and created a text block and then call a prompt on it's that that animates it and it's probably on a graph in a relationship with other things and it can search the graph and it can connect itself to other things and maybe it can do things .

My very abstract, but what would that look like?

So, you know, as you're talking, you say something and then. .

Or even as you're talking, modes are appearing. And links are appearing too, and they both are turned green or not deleteum.

And then if they're green, they go into this this outline.

Now that' outline, I think is materialized back into the next count along with we can keep turncript.

And then maybe it just issues commands, like new node.

Maybe there's an MCP in the loop for updating the graph and the links.

And then the user is also updating the graph and the links.

Anyway.

Animism, everything is alive.

Even everything.
