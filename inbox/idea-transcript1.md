.

Okay.

Okay, this one is a visualization where you take something like what we're doing now.

Like you it's a 2D grid with a D3 four scraph visualization, and you click anywhere on the grid and it makes like a a shadow circle and it starts recording your voice like like we're doing now.

And transcribing, storing that internal maintenance it shows the last word that it transcribed in the circle as you're talking.

And then I guess you click on it or you can also maybe save that you're done.

No, that's fine.

Just .

That's enhancement, it could detect when you're done talking and then hit stockws on.

But anyway, you hit stop and then once that's done, that thing has a location, that it just sits there.

And then . Maybe it gets a little bit bigger or maybe like the camera sort of zooms in out like like the like the um like the 2D space the were in, like the the canvas does a very gentle ease, like 20% closer to it so it moves closer to the center, but it any higher.

Just kind of ease in, like, like bring a little emphasis to it.

So, you know, an animation to the gentle animation, almost like a video game, imagine you're doing the video game transition , the PS4, PS3 era on the very reveal..

Okay.

Okay, so you got the reveal, and then. Crack.

Right, and then, okay, and then on the background from the from off the page from a certain number of these things are added and they're little nodes.

They're smaller circles.

And they sort of have agency.

They're like little like cells.

And they move in. A certain direction, like like six pixels, and then pause, just for like, you know, a very short time.

They move kind of like a cell.

Maybe they maybe especially and squash a little.

Maybe they have some randomness.

Like it's not just like a squish and squash animation with they have some giggle physics as they move, they'd be cool.

But anyway, as they approach the, they have some sort of gravity.

I was actually, you know, just to get started, let's just say their circles and they have an attraction force to the center thing.

So they're going to move towards the center thing as if by osmosis or something. .

No, nice and gentle.

And then they move towards it, and then. Maybe the mouse, like, will disturb their position or something. To make the animation more realistic.

But later we want to click on it.

So I don't do that.

Whatever.

Okay.

Okay, so this thing's moving over to that, and then when it gets there. Basically each of those circles is a process that does an LOM completion. Using the text in there for, no, no, okay.

So then after the person's hits in that thing, then this whole process starts.

So these guys start coming from off the screen.

They start coming towards the center, there's a certain number of only that you can configure it.

Let's say there's eight of them.

And they come towards the center.

No, no, let's say there's three of them .

Let's just say there's one at first.

There's one, and it goes up and it goes up to the the thing, and after you finish talking, and you hit stop, and it does the it stores the transcript internally, and then it takes that transcript.

It does an LN condition and asks it to basically like, summarize take all the sight and describe it in an outline.

It's like a yamgle.

So like, we're doing like like transcripts of Ying. .

So the person might have said, like, oh, no, go back and do this.

I change out.

Wait, no, I didn't mean that.

And that this.

Like, you want to interpret it as if you're actually reading back a transcript.

But just do you best you do your best to generate an outline of what they said.

And then the outline is converted into nodes.

So that from that one circle that you got there, the new nodes are created, they're created right from the center, and they have some sort of a repulsive force that pushes them away, but then there's also there's like a What's it called?

Like a distance force?

Like a circle force?

So they're they basically pushed out to a certain distance within they stay at that distance. And if they're farther than that distance, they come into that distance And then each one has that. Four supplied.

So basically they come up from the center, these notes come out from the center, and they have links too.

There's thick lines connecting the .

And each of those things is one of the lines from that outline.

So now we're breaking the outline out into nodes. Then that thing from the outside basically comes up and looks at the outline and then it asks a question. About one of the nodes.

Whatever node it's the nearestrest, let's say, or whatever those are around it.

The approaches a node, and then asks the note of question. That answer should result in more child votes, like it should break it down though. Or the question, maybe the question attaches, and then the answer would be the extra nodes.

So the question attaches, and then the new nodes grow off of the question.

And then every time a new node grows , at the same time, another new question organism one.

So that's going to grow out and look for it different we can ask a question of and then make more love .

And so then it becomes a simulation of these nodes growing over time.

Maybe it shouldn't be D3.

Maybe it should be a cyo escape or something.

But yeah, basically, like we click down somewhere and then start talking and then even better as you're talking.

Heck yeah, let's do that.

Let's do our best to do something where as you're talking, we're transcribing.

And then .

I guess periodically or repeatedly or iratively, we're doing an L in completion and it's got the transcript and it's got this message that says turn this into it's okay, it's got the outline.

It's got the transcript source, and then it's got the outline, and then the system messages based on the transcript, refine the outline to be more accurate .

And then it produces a new outline.

And then, as I'm talking, the transcript gets longer, and then we feed that album back in in updates.

Something like that.

But it basically, like, as I'm as you're talking, we're creating nodes and it's continuously generating this graph as you're talking. And then the questions and then once you stop talking, you could stop, then one question nobody comes from the outside, then asks a question and then hopefully the answer will result in one or more nodes and not just like a .

Like if the answer is no, it's just we create, like, are like a tombstone, I guess.

Like maybe every leaf has a tombstone, and that means that Yeah, yeah, show a tunestone your mouth.

Yes.

Why not?

No, no.
