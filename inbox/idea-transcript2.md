Okay, now in that year and a half where it's like a garden and in the center is an idea and questions, glum onto it and create a new .

Quest glum onto it and create new nodes and then glow have answers that are auto-generated and then the user muscles over them to preview them and sees a tool tip and then can like click on them I don't know, click on them.

Want, like, click to turn green, and then maybe like long click to delete or something.

But to Mark them deleted.

Yeah, long click, yeah, hold on to delete.

They can you pop them like a z.

Or you click them to turn green or turn back to not green, which is like an una approved state.

I there any question, I think it probably has a re roll button that will regenerate any responses that are green.

It wasn't the idea, though.

So want something turns green. Then it gets prompted with something like .

Given this outline, expand this entry in the outline.

Use whatever tools are needed to perform any research to execute and define additionally items Well, something turns green instead .

And something turns green , then like three seconds later, the L is prompted to expand the outline By listening tool calls , that it would like to make, and now when it's done, we execute all those calls at once, update the graph, and iterate.

Okay, that's it.
