# Concept Processing Prompt

## Task
Review each file in `inbox/` and convert viable concepts into GitHub Projects with detailed issue cards.

## Process for Each Inbox Item

1. **Read the concept note**
2. **Assess viability** - Is this a complete enough idea for a project?
3. **If viable:**
   - Create new GitHub repository 
   - Create corresponding GitHub Project
   - Break concept into detailed issues/cards covering:
     - Core requirements
     - Technical approach 
     - Market analysis (if applicable)
     - Implementation roadmap
     - Any other relevant aspects
   - Move processed file to `processed/` folder
4. **If not viable:**
   - Leave in inbox with comment about what's needed

## Repository Naming
Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated names that clearly indicate the project purpose.

## Issue Structure
Create comprehensive issues that capture all aspects discussed, similar to how Magic Wand and Smart iOS Transcription App were documented.

## Completion
After processing all inbox items, provide summary of:
- Projects created
- Items left in inbox (with reasons)
- Next steps for each project
